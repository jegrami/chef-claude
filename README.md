# Chef Claude

## A recipe app powered by Hugging Face API. 

Enter a list of ingredients, click the `Get Recipe` button, and voilla ... the App return a Nigerian-styled recipe that you might love. 

> [NOTE]
> The app is called chef-claude but uses a different model from Hugging Face to generate the recipe. 
> This is because I orignally wanted to use the Claude API, but then discovered half-way through building the app that Claude API requires credit card subscription. So I had to use Hugging Face but kept the chef claude name because it sounded cooler. 

> [WARNING]
> The Actual model being used under the hood by HF to generate this recipe is shitty as fuck.
